# Rust-Based Augmented Reality Shopping System

## üåê **Project Overview**
The **Rust-Based Augmented Reality Shopping System** is an innovative solution designed to enhance the online shopping experience using **Augmented Reality (AR)**, **AI-powered recommendations**, and **blockchain integration**. This system allows users to virtually try products, receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences, and make payments through secure cryptocurrency transactions‚Äîall within an immersive, interactive AR environment.

By leveraging **Rust**'s performance, **WebAssembly (WASM)** for web support, and modern **AI technologies**, this project brings the next evolution of e-commerce to life with seamless integration across multiple platforms, including **React Native**, **Node.js**, **Python**, and **WebAssembly**.

## ‚ö° **Key Features**
- **Augmented Reality Shopping**: Immersive 3D product visualization for users to interact with products in real-time.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Personalized product suggestions based on AI algorithms and user behavior.
- **Voice Search**: Integration of voice-based search functionality for hands-free shopping.
- **Blockchain Payments**: Secure and decentralized payments using cryptocurrency (Bitcoin).
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Easily integrates with **React Native**, **Node.js**, **Python**, and **WebAssembly** for cross-platform functionality.
- **Real-Time Image Recognition**: Advanced computer vision using ONNX Runtime for real-time object detection and fashion recognition.

## üõ† **Technologies Used**
- **Rust**: The core of the project, ensuring high performance and memory safety.
- **ONNX Runtime**: For running AI models related to image recognition and recommendations.
- **Whisper-RS**: Voice recognition for AI-driven voice search functionality.
- **Bevy**: 3D rendering engine for Augmented Reality visualization.
- **Bitcoin SDK**: For handling cryptocurrency payments in a decentralized manner.
- **Yew** (or **React.js**): For building responsive web frontends.
- **WASM**: To bring Rust's performance to the web via WebAssembly.
- **PyO3 & NAPI**: For binding Rust code to Python and Node.js environments.
- **React Native**: For seamless integration with mobile devices, including iOS and Android.

## üöÄ **How It Works**
1. **AR Experience**: Users can visualize and interact with products in real-time using augmented reality. The system supports 3D models for an engaging experience.
2. **AI Recommendations**: The AI engine fetches personalized product suggestions based on user behavior, past purchases, and similar user profiles.
3. **Voice Search**: Users can search for products using voice commands, making the shopping experience hands-free and more accessible.
4. **Secure Payments**: Bitcoin-based payments allow users to shop securely and anonymously with blockchain-powered transactions.
5. **Cross-Platform Integration**: The system is designed for seamless integration into multiple environments, ensuring that businesses can deploy it on their web platform, mobile apps, or even IoT devices.

## üîß **Project Structure**

The project is divided into several key components to ensure modularity and scalability:

- **`core-lib/`**: The core Rust library, which contains logic for image recognition, AI recommendations, AR rendering, and API communication.
- **`bindings/`**: Platform-specific bindings for various environments, including **Node.js**, **Python**, **React Native**, and **WebAssembly**.
- **`web-plugin/`**: Plugins for **Shopify** and **WooCommerce** to integrate this AR shopping system with popular e-commerce platforms.
- **`ui/`**: The front-end module, built using **Yew** for the web and **React Native** for mobile applications, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation for the project setup, installation, and usage.

## üñ• **Installation & Setup**
Follow these steps to integrate the Augmented Reality Shopping System into your application:

### 1. **Set Up Rust Development Environment**
Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### 2. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ar-shopping-system.git
cd ar-shopping-system
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
Install necessary dependencies for the Rust environment and the desired bindings (Node.js, Python, React Native):
```bash
cargo build
```

### 4. **Build for WebAssembly (Optional)**
To build the project for the web:
```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

### 5. **Run Example Application**
You can test the system by running the example in the `tests/demo.rs` file:
```bash
cargo test
```

---

## üí¨ **Usage**
The system is designed to be highly customizable and can be integrated with existing e-commerce platforms. Below are a few examples of how you can use the different modules:

### **For Node.js:**
```javascript
const { detectFaceNative } = require('your-node-module');
detectFaceNative('image_path.jpg');
```

### **For Python:**
```python
from your_python_module import detect_face_py
print(detect_face_py('image_path.jpg'))
```

### **For React Native:**
```javascript
import { RustModule } from 'your-react-native-module';
RustModule.detectFaceNative('image_path.jpg');
```
